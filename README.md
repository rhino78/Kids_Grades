# Kids_Grades
a useful script that texts me my kids grades everyday

My kids go to a school district where they have an online tool that allows to you see the grades, and how they are doing. 

This is my take on how I automated this process to give me an update at 3:30pm everyday on how they are doing...just in time for them to arrive home :)
